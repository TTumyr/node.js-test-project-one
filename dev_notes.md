## node.js-test-project-one development notes (issues, todo, etc)

---

ToDo => create separation between app/routes/controls when or if the project gets bigger.

FIXED Issues => Connection to MongoDB currently not working properly. Performs CRUD, not waiting for data on app.get.
Seems to be working just as well with listening triggered outside of the connection string => TODO test this with delay.
